...The selected paper is about the application of Bayesian Network for Food Safety Risk in Cattle Slaughtering IndustryIntroduction Nowadays, food safety has an important role for consumers ....
...Fulfillment of the aspect of food safety is also encouraged to reduce consumer concerns about food safety, especially from the hazards of pesticide residues, preservatives, and hormones in livestock....
...The survey results in China show that consumer concern for food safety is indicated by buying food in supermarkets, expiration dates, food color and nutritional content.The inconsistency of the food industry in implementing food safety has a negative impact on consumers....
...This study aims to: identify the risk event of food safety....
...Measure the opportunities for these risks with Bayesian Network....
...This activity aims to observe the process of slaughtering animals (cattle) so that the risk event for food safety can be identified....
...Code Y is be used if the observed activities identified are at risk of food safety....
...Risk statistical analysis At this stage, data is processed by one of the statistical methods, namely the Bayesian Network (BN)....
...(d) preparing conditional probability table (CPT)Stages Stages 1)  Identification of Risk Event: This stage aims to identify risk events in cattle slaughtering industry which can lead to food safety contamination.These risk events are nodes of our BN....
...Here we can see the prior probabilities of the root nodes: Stage 3)  Development of Bayesian network structure: This stage aims to develop the Bayesian Network structure....
...Furthermore, the structure will be used to show the relationship between risk events that occur in the cattle slaughtering industry.This is the structure of our Bayesian network: Stage 4)  Calculation for Condition Probability Table (CPT): Risk event probability is used as the basis for  calculations in the Bayesian Network....
...As a first step in the Bayesian Network, a Bayesian Network structure should be arranged....
...The structure of Bayesian network illustrates the relationship between food safety risks that have been identified....
...The probability shows that the opportunity for food safety contamination is 24%.Stage 5)  Analysis of Food Safety Risk in Cattle Slaughtering Industry: This stage is carried out to analyze the probability of the occurrence of food safety risks with the Bayesian Network....
...This process has the highest risk of contamination with food safety....
...For this reason, the improvement process is focused on improving the slaughter process....
...In more detail, the slaughter process has 4 risk events that need attention (Fs3, Fs4, Fs5, Fs6).Based on Figure 3, the priority of improvements to  reduce the risk of contaminated food safety is at the risk event Fs3 (not sharp knife) and Fs4 (risk of cow body parts is not safe)....
...Direct cause We can see from the network pre-slaughtering process (P1) directly affect on the risk in food safety (risk). that means whenever some changes in pre-slaughtering process (P1) happens it will have effect on food safety (risk).4.2....
